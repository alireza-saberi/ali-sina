# ali-sina
Simple practice between Sina and I to connect his Android app with back-end express app

## Three apps are available for Sina to call:
- sina : which responces back 'Hello Sina' to his mobile app request
- fortune: which responces back with random fortune string to him; like a fotune cookie :sob:
- database: which returns some objects that I saved in Mongolab

## Instructions
- Install the Node modules to have dependencies in project directory.
`install npm`
- Run `node serve.js`
- Just send a AJAX request to `'/sina'` and `'/fortune'` with your mobile app
- There is nothing really specific on web, really :imp: ,but you can bring it up if you want on browser by typing `localhost:3000`
- Yes, server is on port number `3000`
